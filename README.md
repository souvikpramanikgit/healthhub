## Inspiration
Let's face it - healthcare access can be challenging. Patients often struggle to find the right facilities, and healthcare providers need efficient ways to connect with their communities. We built Hospital Hub Nexus because we believe everyone deserves easy access to healthcare information. Our goal? Leverage modern technology to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers.

## What it does
Think of Hospital Hub Nexus as your healthcare navigator:
* Search for hospitals based on your location using pincode
* Get real-time information about hospital services and availability
* Filter hospitals by specific medical services
* View detailed hospital profiles, including contact information and distance
* Access cached data for offline use when the internet is unavailable


## How we built it
We combined the latest technologies to create a robust platform:
* Developed a responsive interface using React and TypeScript
* Styled the application with Tailwind CSS for a modern look
* Integrated OpenStreetMap APIs for accurate geolocation and hospital data
* Utilized IndexedDB for offline data storage and caching
* Ensured a smooth user experience with React Router for navigation
* Implemented error handling and loading states for better usability


## Challenges we ran into
Building a healthcare platform comes with its own set of challenges. We had to:
* Ensure accurate data retrieval from external APIs while maintaining performance
* Handle offline scenarios gracefully with cached data
* Design a user-friendly interface that caters to diverse user needs
* Optimize the application for various devices and screen sizes


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're excited about what we've achieved:
* Created a user-friendly platform that simplifies hospital searches
* Successfully integrated multiple APIs for real-time data access
* Built a secure application that respects user privacy
* Developed a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop
* Enabled offline functionality to enhance user experience


## What we learned
This journey has been a learning experience:
* API integration requires careful planning and testing
* User feedback is crucial for improving the application
* Offline capabilities are essential for accessibility in healthcare
* Good design enhances usability and user satisfaction
* Collaboration and communication are key in development.
